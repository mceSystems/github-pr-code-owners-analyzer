## Features

- üë• Shows users who can individually approve all changed files
- ü§ù Identifies combinations of users who together can approve all changes
- ‚úÖ Highlights which owners have already approved the PR
- üéØ Updates in real-time as files change in the PR
- üñ±Ô∏è Draggable UI panel with collapsible sections

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files
5. The extension icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Usage

1. Navigate to any GitHub pull request's "Files changed" tab
2. The Code Owners Analysis panel will appear on the right side
3. The panel shows two main sections:
   - **Full Coverage Owners**: Users who can individually approve all changed files
   - **Combined Coverage Sets**: Groups of users who together can approve all files
4. Green checkmarks (‚úì) indicate owners who have already approved the PR
5. Hover over the info icons (‚ÑπÔ∏è) for more details about each section

   - Double-click section titles or use arrows to collapse/expand sections

## Development

The extension consists of these main files:

- `styles.css`: UI styling

## Notes
